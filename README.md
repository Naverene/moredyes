# More Dyes

More Dyes adds more than 100 new dye colors to Minecraft, with stone, wood, wool, glass, chests, sheep and more in every color. Download it from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/moredyes) or from this repository's releases.

This repository holds every version of the mod, one folder per Minecraft version:

| Folder | Minecraft | Loader | Java |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [1.7.10](1.7.10) | 1.7.10 | Forge (GTNH buildscript) | 8 to play, 21 to build |
| [1.12.2](1.12.2) | 1.12.2 | Forge | 8 |
| [1.16.5](1.16.5) | 1.16.5 | Forge | 8 |
| [1.18.2](1.18.2) | 1.18.2 | Forge | 17 |
| [1.20.1](1.20.1) | 1.20.1 | Forge | 17 |
| [1.20.1-fabric](1.20.1-fabric) | 1.20.1 | Fabric (needs Fabric API) | 17 to play, 21 to build |
| [26.3](26.3) | 26.3 | NeoForge | 25 |

Each Minecraft folder is its own Gradle project with its own wrapper. Open the folder for the version you want in your IDE (not the repository root), and run `./gradlew build` inside it. The jar lands in that folder's `build/libs` as `moredyes-<mod version>-<Minecraft version>.jar` (with `-fabric` on the end for Fabric). The Fabric build uses the models, textures, recipes and other data files from the Forge folder of the same Minecraft version, so it needs that folder next to it.

## Builds and releases

[`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml) builds each version on its own Java and checks that it loads on a server.

- Pull requests build only the versions they change.
- Every push to the default branch (`main`) builds all versions and replaces the **Development build** pre-release with the newest jar for each one.
- Pushing a tag such as `v1.2.0` builds every version as mod version 1.2.0, publishes a release with all the jars, and uploads each jar to CurseForge (project 252137) when the `CURSEFORGE_TOKEN` secret is set. Push the tag with git (`git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0`) or make the release on GitHub; both work.

## History

Each folder used to be its own repository. Their full histories were brought in here, so `git log -- 1.16.5` shows the 1.16.5 version's history. The old repositories are Naverene/MoreDyes_1_7_10, moredyes_1122, moredyes_1165, moredyes_1182, moredyes_1201 and moredyes_263.

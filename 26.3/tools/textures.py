"""Builds the grey textures that dyed blocks are tinted from.

Each dyed block is drawn from one grey texture multiplied by its dye color (see
client/Tints.java), the same way 1.7.10 More Dyes and vanilla grass work. The
grey textures are made from the vanilla textures: each pixel keeps its
brightness and loses its color, and the texture is then brightened so that dark
materials like stone still show their dye clearly.

Some vanilla textures are split into two layers: a grey part that takes the dye
color, and a part that keeps its own color and is drawn over it untinted (a
tulip's stem, a sapling's trunk, the wood and iron on a piston).

TEXTURES below is also read by generate_resources.py, which uses it to point
the models at these textures.
